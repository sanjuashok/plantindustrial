*Plant Industrial* is an attempt to cover the food economy. There are a lot of publications out there that talk about the way we consume our food. Not too many cover the farmers, entrepreneurs, and business owners who produce the food that ends up on our plates. 

At *Plant Industrial* we're going to write about how the food we eat is grown, where it comes from, and the challenges and stories of the people who make it possible.

I'll be sending out a (hopefully) weekly newsletter which you can subscribe to above. There will be blog updates about my experiences in food entrepreneurship (exclusively!) here on this site.

If you're interested in connected with me, reach out at me@sanju.io or through twitter @sanjuashok.
