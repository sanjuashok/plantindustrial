*Plant Industrial* is an attempt to make sense of - and a commentary on - the plant based economy. If you're interested in the growing vegan and vegetarian food industry, whether you're an investor, entrepreneur, or just some random person with an odd affinity for plant based foods, then I'm hoping this newsletter/site is a good resource for you.

I - meaning me, Sanju Ashok - am an aspiring food entrepreneur. Through *Plant Industrial*, I want to learn about the food system and my place in it. A plant heavy diet is better for the climate, is more efficient, healthier, and provides vast opportunities for moral superiority. I'm hoping to interview people across the supply chain from farmers to our corporate overlords at Safeway and Publix. Highly subjective analysis will also be provided.

I'll be sending out a weekly newsletter which you can subscribe to above. There will be blog updates about my experiences in food entrepreneurship (exclusively!) here on this site.

If you're interested in connected with me, reach out at me@sanju.io or through twitter @sanjuashok.
